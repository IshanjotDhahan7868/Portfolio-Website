        <p class="section-text">
          WealthPilot is a simple investing projection tool that helps everyday people understand the long‑term impact of their investment decisions. Users can model different contribution plans, expected returns and time horizons to see how their wealth could grow over time.
        </p>
        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p class="section-text">
          Many investment calculators are either overly simplistic or overly complex. They don’t let users compare different contribution packages, factor in inflation, or visualize how small changes in monthly savings affect long‑term wealth. As a result, people struggle to plan effectively for retirement or big purchases.
        </p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p class="section-text">
          WealthPilot allows users to define multiple “packages” representing monthly contributions and expected annual returns. The tool calculates future values using compound interest formulas and displays interactive charts of the projected growth. Users can add inflation adjustments and see side‑by‑side comparisons of their packages.
        </p>
        <h3>Tech Stack</h3>
        <ul class="section-text" style="text-align:left; display:inline-block; margin:0 auto;">
          <li>Vanilla JavaScript for calculations</li>
          <li>Chart.js for interactive charts</li>
          <li>Lightweight HTML/CSS without any frameworks</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>My Role & Challenges</h3>
        <p class="section-text">
          I built WealthPilot as an exercise in creating a straightforward yet flexible financial calculator. I implemented compound interest math functions, built dynamic forms for users to add or remove packages, and integrated Chart.js for data visualization. The main challenge was structuring the UI to remain simple while supporting multiple scenarios and ensuring the math remained precise across different time periods.
